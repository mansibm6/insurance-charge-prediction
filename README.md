# Predicting Insurance Charges using Neural Networks

#### -- Project Status: [On Hold] (Will work on reducing the error)

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the charges for insurance based on age, sex, BMI, region etc using a neural network.

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization
* Regression Analysis

### Technologies
* Python
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Neural Networks

## Project Description
In this project, I worked on a dataset containing various information like sex, age, number of children, smoker, and region and used this data to predict the insurance charges by creating a neural network.
